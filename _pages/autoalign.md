<h2>AutoAlign™ is an automated MRI slice prescription software application that can be embedded in an MRI scanner’s system software.</h2>
Conventionally, MRI scans of the brain are aligned differently from site to site, from subject to subject within a site, and during repeat scans for a single subject. Due to reliance upon manual judgment-based processes, alignment and prescription applications suffer from a high degree of variability between exam sessions. This variability increases the variation in the rescan process, making it less reliable and more problematic for precise side-by-side comparisons or computer-aided volumetric analysis. It also produces inconsistent alignment, which makes standard 2-D viewing protocols for Radiologists (film and PACS based) more complex and inefficient. AutoAlign™ was created specifically to solve this challenge, correcting for differences in patient positioning between scans.

AutoAlign™ is included in NeuroQuant® and cleared for marketing as a medical device by the US FDA [510(k) K061855]. It is available for nonexclusive licensing to MRI OEMs, and since 2004, has been included as an option in the intelligent workflow system of a major MRI system vendor.

<h2> The Benefits of AutoAlign™</h2>
AutoAlign™ corrects for differences in patient positioning between scans. The consistent anatomical alignment provided by use of AutoAlign™ during the MRI acquisition process can:
<ol>
 	<li>Increase the speed and accuracy of visual identification of structures and abnormalities in individuals.</li>
 	<li>Facilitate between subject comparisons in structures of interest.</li>
 	<li>Improve detection of change over time in serial imaging studies.</li>
 	<li>Enhance patient throughput, a critical economic factor to maximize profit in imaging centers with high fixed costs.</li>
</ol>
