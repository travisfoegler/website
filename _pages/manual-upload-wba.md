<h2>Processing Scans by Manual Upload</h2>
<h4>What is Manual Upload?</h4>
<p class="margin">Manual upload is an easy way to use the cloud-based version system from a DICOM saved file on a CD/DVD.  Manual upload gives you the ability to upload the MRI and PET scan to your Online account and retrieve the results. Simply follow the instructions provided and in a few minutes you will have a much more seamless online experience.</p>

<ul>
 	<li class="margin">Manual upload can be used with Mac or Windows computers.</li>
 	<li class="margin">Simply export the uncompressed archive file to a Zip file (or other file as per instructions) prior to uploading to the online system.</li>
 	<li class="margin">When processing is complete, you will be able to retrieve the output data and return them to your configured PACS or viewer destination.</li>
</ul>
