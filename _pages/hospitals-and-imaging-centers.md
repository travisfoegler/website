<h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong> </strong><strong>Significantly increase referrals by offering the highest standard of imaging with NeuroQuant.</strong></h1>
NeuroQuant is the first FDA cleared, CE marked, and Health Canada licensed medical device for automatic labeling, visualization and volumetric quantification of segmentable brain structures, from a set of MR images. In the clinic, NeuroQuant assists physicians in the quantification of brain structure volumes, integrating sophisticated, fast, accurate and fully-automated MRI post-processing capabilities within your existing PACS environment.

Referring physicians have been seeking such information from brain structure since the time that imaging first made it possible to directly visualize brain anatomy. Beyond the requisite “ruling out” of structural lesions, quantification can provide objective support for or against neurodegeneration in the setting of cognitive complaint (much like a CK-MB or Troponin suggests heart damage in the setting of chest pain). More than two decades of research has demonstrated the value of quantitative radiology in improving accuracy in the early diagnosis of neurodegenerative disease, and perhaps even more importantly, in suggesting a physician might redouble efforts to identify a curable mimic in cases where there is no objective support for neurodegeneration.

NeuroQuant provides your radiologists with a convenient and cost-effective means to quantify volumes of brain structures. This enables them to provide a superior and more complete clinical read to your referring physician network, critically assisting them in their clinical assessment of a variety of brain disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease, epilepsy and traumatic brain injury. Such reads will drive additional referrals to your imaging center and away from the competition. Adding NeuroQuant expertise to your center will help:[/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width="1/4"][vc_column_text]
