These additional scanner options greatly benefit our customers, offering the ability use NeuroQuant brain segmentation accurately and consistently on these scanners, in addition to 1.5T and 3.0T GE, Philips and Siemens and Toshiba Titian 3T MRI scanners.

Over the past few months, CorTechs Labs engineering team validated the 1.5T Toshiba and Hitachi MRI scanners to ensure accurate and consistent brain segmentation results. The findings were impressive. The both scanners showed excellent image quality and contrast allowing for accurate segmentation, and was found to be on par with other validated vendors.

The incorporation of the 1.5T Toshiba and Hitachi scanners into NeuroQuant scanner compatibility allows physicians and researchers more freedom in MRI scanner choices when using NeuroQuant for additional supportive volumetric data to enrich their clinical treatment planning and disease progression monitoring of patients with neurodegenerative conditions, such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimerâ€™s disease, epilepsy and traumatic brain injury.
