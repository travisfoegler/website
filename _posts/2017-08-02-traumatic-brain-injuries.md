Of the 1.5 million traumatic brain injuries (TBI) every year, 80% of them are considered mild. A “mild TBI”, often referred to as a concussion, is defined as loss of consciousness and/or confusion and disorientation, which is shorter than 30 minutes and an initial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 13-15.

A patient a with mild TBI does not initially present with any visible pathology, such as fractures, contusions, and hemorrhages. Long-term, however, the patient may possess disabling cognitive, psychological, and/or behavioral impairments and employment disabilities. In fact, recent studies have demonstrated that neurologic and psychiatric problems persist in 10-50% of brain trauma patients and maybe severe enough that cognitive defects never return to a pre-injury state.

Any injury to the brain can generate significant loss of brain volume, which in turn can initiate neuropathological changes, such as the presence of certain biomarkers (β-amyloid and tau), as well as neuroinflammatory changes. These changes can cause a younger aged brain to have symptoms that resemble an older neurodegenerative brain.

Using MRI scans and sophisticated software tools for quantitative imaging (<a href="http://www.cortechslabs.com/neuroquant">NeuroQuant</a>) to analyze the resulting images has become a significant element in the assessment of patients with TBI. Volumetric MRI studies performed after a brain injury can provide physicians with regional and whole brain volumes, which can be followed over time. This is especially meaningful, as global and regional brain atrophy from a single minor brain injury or concussion, can be detected one year after the injury.

NeuroQuant is a leading medical device software that automatically and accurately segments and calculates brain structure volumes from the 3D MR images, thereby providing anatomic information about the brain in a non-invasive fashion.

For physicians evaluating TBI, the <a href="http://www.cortechslabs.com/neuroquant/tba">Triage Brain Atrophy report</a> provides volume measurements of 39 left and right brain structures and indicates the patient’s brain structure volume measurements as compared to a healthy population (CorTechs Labs’<a href="https://www.cortechslabs.com/whitepapers/"> normative reference data</a>). This information provides physicians with an accurate indication of where an individual’s brain structure volumes are compared with their age- and gender-matched peers. The Triage Brain Atrophy report provides critical supporting quantitative volumetric data to aid physicians in their assessment of TBI.
