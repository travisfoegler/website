In mid-October, we announced the latest software release of NeuroQuant. This latest version, based almost entirely on customer feedback, adds exciting new features to the current version of NeuroQuant, including the ability for NeuroQuant users to customize their own volumetric reports.

The <a href="https://www.cortechslabs.com/neuroquant/custom/">NeuroQuant Custom Volumetric</a> report allows physicians to individually tailor NeuroQuant reports relevant to their clinical cases. Users are able to choose between left, right, total brain structure volume, as well as left-right asymmetry for up to 9 different brains structures per report.
