NeuroQuant volumetric reports can contain a lot of numeric data that needs to be transcribed by reviewing radiologists. To save time dictating the numerical values of each NeuroQuant report, CorTechs Labs has developed a integration for NeuroQuant with <a href="https://www.cortechslabs.com/powerscribe-integration/">PowerScribeÂ® 360</a> , allowing radiologists to quickly and effortlessly by pre-populate NeuroQuant data into their radiology reports.

<ul>
 	<li>For NeuroQuant and/or LesionQuant</li>
 	<li>Values populated prior to report dictation</li>
 	<li>Save time dictating NeuroQuant data</li>
 	<li>Reduce the likelihood of transcription errors</li>
</ul>
NeuroQuant is compatible with PowerScribe 360 version 3.0 and higher. If you are using PowerScribe version 3.5 of higher, CorTechs Labs has developed the necessary auto text and custom field templates to make the integration setup fast and easy.

<a href="https://www.cortechslabs.com/contact/">Contact your sales representative toda</a>y to learn more about how both NeuroQuant installed and online users can save time, and achieve data-rich, accurate reporting when dictating NeuroQuant results for referring physicians with this integration.

<strong>Requirements for Use:</strong>
A PowerScribe integration license from CorTechs Labs, PowerScribe 360 software, and CTXNode are required for NeuroQuant users to have this reporting feature enabled.
