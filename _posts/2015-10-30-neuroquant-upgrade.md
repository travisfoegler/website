Combining all the features and benefits, we can precisely say that NeuroQuant 2.0 is a proven medical device software for automated brain image analysis, delivering more accurate, consistent and reproducible brain volume information. NeuroQuant 2.0 provides the following benefits:
<ul>
 	<li>Age-Based Personalized segmentation using the proprietary Dynamic Atlas™ technology</li>
 	<li>Improved and robust segmentation even for difficult scans (due to patient anatomy or sub-optimal scan quality)</li>
 	<li>Improved cross scanner reproducibility</li>
 	<li>Greater scan to scan precision</li>
 	<li>Reliable segmentation and quantitative volume assessment of brain regions for ages from 3 to 100 years</li>
 	<li>New reports provide volumetric information and comparison to normative values for a large variety of brain structures.</li>
</ul>
Over the past few weeks, we have blogged about some topics to provide additional insight into the NeuroQuant 2.0 release. These posts provide slivers of the vast NeuroQuant 2.0 upgrade.
