<strong>Have you heard the news?
</strong><span style="color: #c8042c;"><a style="color: #c8042c;" href="http://www.cortechslabs.com/neuroquant">NeuroQuant</a></span>®'s automated, quantitative MRI analysis can now be integrated with PowerScribe® 360 to streamline dictation of NeuroQuant results.

<strong>Why is this important?
</strong>NeuroQuant, is a leading medical device software which automatically labels, segments and quantifies volume of brain structures from 3D volumetric MR scans. NeuroQuant reports provide quantitative data to supplement visual reads and help physicians in their assessment of neurological conditions, such as Alzheimer’s disease, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, brain trauma, as well as brain development.

<strong>What does this integration provide?</strong>
With the PowerScribe 360 integration, all NeuroQuant volumetric and reference data are pre-populated into a PowerScribe 360 report template prior to dictation, eliminating the time consuming dictation of numeric results, thereby streamlining report dictation and reducing the likelihood of transcription errors.

Additionally, customizable, flexible templating makes it possible for radiologists to quickly create reports that conform to institutional standards while reducing the dictation burden.

<strong>Who benefits from this integration?
</strong>Radiologists at hospitals, clinics, imaging and research centers worldwide can benefit from this expanded capability, resulting in more time-efficient, data-rich and accurate reporting when reading NeuroQuant results.

<strong>What are the system requirements?
</strong>PowerScribe 360 integration works with both cloud based and locally installed NeuroQuant 2.0 systems.
