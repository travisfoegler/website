CorTechs Labs is pleased to have had NeuroQuant and LesionQuant featured in several posters at both ASNR 2017 (Long Beach) and AAN 2017 (Boston).

CorTechs Labs’ fast, accurate and proven quantitative imaging solutions are the first FDA cleared and CE marked software that provides radiologists and neurologists with quantifiable, volumetric data for brain atrophy (<a href="http://www.cortechslabs.com/neuroquant">NeuroQuant</a>) and lesion evolution (<a href="http://www.cortechslabs.com/lesionquant">LesionQuant</a>). Links to the abstracts are below.
