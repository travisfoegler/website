<strong>Stop by Booth 116 at AAIC 2017 for a first-hand demonstration of our quantitative volumetric brain analysis products for PET and MRI.</strong>

CorTechs Labs will be exhibiting at the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference (AAIC) in London. Meet <a href="www.cortechslabs.com/neuroquant"><img class="wp-image-7082 alignright" src="https://www.cortechslabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/NQ-reports-computer.png" alt="" width="260" height="168" /></a>with us during the conference July 16-19 to learn more about our quantitative volumetric image products.

<a href="http://www.cortechslabs.com">CorTechs Labs</a> offers physicians and researchers the ability to examine volumetric imaging biomarkers, which can be used individually or in combination in the initial and ongoing evaluation of cognitive impairment and memory loss.
