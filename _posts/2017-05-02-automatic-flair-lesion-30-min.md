Meet with us at CMSC (New Orleans, May 24-26) at Booth 603 to learn more about how <a href="http://www.cortechslabs.com/lesionquant">LesionQuant</a>, a <a href="http://www.cortechslabs.com/neuroquant">NeuroQuant</a> product, provides clinical <em>in vivo</em> quantitative MRI biomarkers, anatomical lesion distribution, volume, count and lesion burden, all of which is particularly interesting for Multiple Sclerosis.
<ul>
 	<li>Discover how to support your clinical impression with<strong> fully automated, fast, accurate and proven</strong> MR image segmentation and volumetric analysis for ages 3 to 100 years.</li>
 	<li>Practice evidenced-based medicine using<strong> LesionQuant</strong> to derive meaningful, numeric data from MRI scans when evaluating lesion load and brain volume loss due to multiple sclerosis.</li>
 	<li>Easily review <strong>FLAIR lesion segmentation</strong> through color-coded FLAIR image overlays to aid in evaluation and disease progression monitoring.</li>
 	<li>Quickly and accurately<strong> identify and monitor new and enlarging lesions</strong>, all without the need or added risk of Gadolinium, with color-coded FLAIR lesion change visualization directly on your PACS or DICOM viewer.</li>
 	<li>Directly impact patient care (based on the current <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26585439">NEDA-4</a> guidelines), boost referrals from (MS) neurologists.<strong> </strong></li>
</ul>
