When using NeuroQuant, physicians have access to longitudinal tracking via our multi time point feature, allowing them to see a clear progression of any changes to a patient’s relevant brain structures.

The results of current measurement (colored in black) and the prior measurements (colored in gray) are displayed on a single report allowing the physician to quickly and easily evaluate any trend in the patient’s brain volume. This feature provides physicians with additional information for ongoing patient evaluation, and is especially helpful in continuing care for patients with chronic neurodegeneration.

The multi time point feature is available on the <a href="https://www.cortechslabs.com/neuroquant/age">Age Related Atrophy</a>, <a href="https://www.cortechslabs.com/neuroquant/asym">Hippocampal Asymmetry</a>, <a href="https://www.cortechslabs.com/neuroquant/msa">Multi Structure Atrophy</a>, <a href="https://www.cortechslabs.com/neuroquant/bd">Brain Development </a>and <a href="http://www.cortechslabs.com/lesionquant">LesionQuant</a> reports.

The images below demonstrate the benefit of the multi time point feature for ongoing patient evaluations.
