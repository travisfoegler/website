In addition to providing automated and fast brain structure segmentation, NeuroQuant produces color-coded overlays in which each color represents a different region of interest. The color-coding allows physicians to effortlessly review the segmentation. Also, for physicians wanting to examine a structure or structures that are not on the NeuroQuant output report, they can easily locate the structure by its associated color.

The images below show a MR T1-weighted images (left) and NeuroQuant segmentation overlaying a T1-weighted image (right). The table below the images provides the structure and associated color.<a href="https://www.cortechslabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Color-coded-ROI.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6689" src="https://www.cortechslabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/T1-weightd-and-NQ.png" alt="" width="515" height="277" /></a><a href="https://www.cortechslabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Color-coded-ROI-2.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6698 size-full" src="https://www.cortechslabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Color-coded-ROI-2.png" alt="" width="668" height="470" /></a>To learn more about the importance of using quantitative volumetric imaging for brain MRI in clinical practice, check out our <a href="https://www.cortechslabs.com/whitepapers/">latest CorTechs Labs white paper.</a>
