CorTechs Labs is proud to offer our customers validated scanner compatibility and recommended scanner settings. This program provides physicians and researchers more freedom in choice of MRI scanners and larger flexibility for patients to be scheduled on a wider range of scanners.

The CorTechs Labs Engineering team performs validation and compatibility testing to ensure accurate and consistent brain segmentation results when using CorTechs Labs’ quantitative MR imaging software to acquire quantifiable, volumetric data. Physicians can use this additional data in their assessment of neurodegenerative conditions, such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, traumatic brain injury and epilepsy.

1.2T Oasis, 1.5T Echelon Oval and 3.0T Trillium Oval MRI scanners from Hitachi are compatible with NeuroQuant automated MRI post-processing brain image analysis solutions. Notably, the Hitachi 1.2T Oasis is an open MRI scanner, helping physicians accommodate a broader patient demographic for neurodegenerative evaluations.

1.5T and 3.0T MRI scanners from GE, Philips Siemens and Toshiba can also be used to obtain this volumetric data.
