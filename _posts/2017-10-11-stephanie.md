<a href="https://www.cortechslabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Stephanie.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-7327 alignright" src="https://www.cortechslabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Stephanie.jpg" alt="" width="146" height="157" /></a>StephanieÂ wants to live in a world full of creativity, on demand warm chocolate chip cookies and a force field around her keyboard that repels dog slobber and sticky-fingered pre-schoolers.

Stephanie has loved science from an early age and really enjoys being a part of a company focused on helping physicians improve their patient care through advances in technology.

As the Marketing Manager at CorTechs Labs, Stephanie is responsible for marketing, branding and communications. Her main focus is to develop eye-catching and informative collateral that helps potential customers better understand how our products can aid in their neurological assessments. Stephanie received an International MBA from the University of South Carolina and has a BA in Biology with a minor in Biochemistry from the University of Colorado at Boulder. Go Buffs!

Around the office, Stephanie can be found with a La Croix and some form of chocolate. She is a liker of well written copy and a lover of sticking to timelines. Stephanie has tried to learn 4 different languages... She remains only able to speak coherently in English. She also enjoys a good book, traveling abroad, and lots (LOTS!) of coffee in the morning.
