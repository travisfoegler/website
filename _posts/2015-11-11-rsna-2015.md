<ol>
 	<li><strong>Streamline your MRI review</strong> with NeuroQuant report outputs of color-coded brain segmentation perfectly aligned to atlas with coronal, sagittal and axial images and absolute and relative volumes of a broad range of subcortical structures.</li>
 	<li>Use NeuroQuant to derive meaningful, numeric data<strong> </strong>from your 3D T1 MRI scans which can help <strong>provide evidence of tissue damage and pathology</strong>.</li>
 	<li><strong>Provides help in detecting and quantifing brain atrophy</strong> to support your clinical impression with fully automated, quantitative volumetric image segmentation and analysis.</li>
 	<li>NeuroQuant is the <strong>first FDA cleared and CE marked medical device</strong> software for routine clinical or research use.</li>
 	<li>Obtain objective data through quantitative MRI measurements with <strong>six unique reports to</strong> <strong>aid clinical assessment and monitor disease progression</strong>.</li>
 	<li><strong>Develop a more accurate understanding</strong> of lobes and sub-regions affected by trauma or disease.</li>
 	<li><strong>Identify degeneration and mimics at the earliest stages for treatment and lifestyle planning</strong>. With NeuroQuant, statements like “mild involutional changes” and “age-appropriate atrophy” are explored more thoroughly and objectively to help you determine your patient’s clinical course.</li>
 	<li><strong>Perform ongoing patient evaluations</strong> to track brain changes in patients with atrophy which may be due to Alzheimer’s, frontotemporal dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or traumatic brain injury.</li>
 	<li>Reliably, consistently and accurately<strong> evaluate patients from ages 3 to 100</strong>.

And the number 1 reason...</li>
 	<li><strong>We are eager to meet with you and discuss NeuroQuant first hand!</strong> CorTechs Labs will have a large, knowledgeable contingent at RSNA excited to demonstrate and explain the benefits of automated brain image analysis.</li>
</ol>
Convinced? Great! <strong>Stop by Booth 1861 (Hall A, South) at RSNA</strong> and let us provide you with additional information. Or schedule a meeting with us below. See you in Chicago!
