<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Blackford joins CorTechs Labs to provide workflow automation, efficiency improvements, and advance medical standards while improving patient outcomes and reducing care costs.</em></p>
(SAN DIEGO) Aug. 9, 2018 - CorTechs Labs, a leader in brain imaging analysis technology, announced it has partnered with Blackford Analysis to offer its software through Blackford’s single marketplace platform. The partnership will provide Blackford clients with access to NeuroQuant and LesionQuant, fully automated segmentation applications for the evaluation of brain structure volume changes relevant to neurodegenerative diseases.

Customers will receive the same fast and easy imaging and report processing as a direct CorTechs Labs customer along with the objective and reproducible brain structure volumes and normative percentiles to aid in diagnosing and monitoring of disease progression and treatment outcomes in patients with neurodegenerative disorders.

Intelerad, a leading enterprise workflow solutions provider and partner of Blackford will now be able to utilize this technology through their platform.  Through its user interface tool “Inteleviewer,” Intelerad can access CorTechs Labs’ imaging application and achieve a new, simplified and quick approach to image analysis. Condition-specific, actionable information enables healthcare professionals to achieve better patient outcomes and improve diagnostic confidence.

“We are pleased to partner with Blackford,” said Dr. Chris Airriess, COO of CorTechs Labs. “NeuroQuant has become the standard for brain volume measurements, and this partnership will expand quantitative neurological imaging by making it even easier to integrate into clinical workflows."

The partnership provides CorTechs Labs with an extended network of healthcare and medical imaging providers as well as added value for Blackford’s all-in-one marketplace platform. CorTechs Labs cloud-based technology also allows Blackford Analysis to sync new software updates as they are released, providing users with the latest and most up-to-date reports. CorTechs Labs and Blackford Analysis look to continue their partnership through the improvement and advancement of automation and neuroimaging technology.
