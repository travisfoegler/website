Nigel enjoys being a part of an innovative company focused on improving patient care through technology.

As the Director of Sales, Nigel uses his degree in Neural Science from Brown University to showcase CorTechs Labs' amazing software.  He enjoys talking to customers and helping them understand the benefits of quantitative imaging and working with them to get them up and running with the software.

Nigel is an avid Steelers and Penguins fan (which is the law, when one is born and raised in Pittsburgh).  He has English parents, but doesn’t have the cool British accent. However, he does have straight teeth!  Nigel played Division I soccer at Brown and still enjoys playing today. Nigel finds any excuse to eat Mexican food and speak Spanglish. He especially enjoys tormenting his colleagues with bad jokes.
