PETQuant provides automated and fast post-acquisition analyses of PET brain studies to quantify subregional tracer binding in native patient brain space, and is compatible with metabolic (FDG) and amyloid-based (florbetapir) tracers.

PETQuant expands the use of NeuroQuant®’s proven and trusted segmentation technology by offering an additional research tool in the evaluation of neurodegenerative dementias, such as Alzheimer’s disease and frontotemporal dementia.
