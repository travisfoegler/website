On April 28-30, CorTechs Labs is looking forward to meeting you at the<a href="https://www.aan.com/conferences/2014-annual-meeting/"> American Academy of Neurology Annual Conference</a> in Philadelphia.  Here's why you should come find us:
<ol>
 	<li><strong>NeuroQuant will help you identify evidence of neurodegeneration.</strong> Our flagship product, NeuroQuant, is the first FDA cleared medical device that detects and quantifies brain atrophy, and will let you make quantitative MRI measurement a routine part of your clinical practice or research. Use this product to derive meaningful, numeric data<strong> </strong>from your 3D T1 MRI scans.</li>
 	<li><strong>As a referring physician, you can achieve a more accurate predictive prognosis for your patients. </strong>With NeuroQuant statements like “mild involutional changes” and “age-appropriate atrophy” are explored more thoroughly and objectively to help you predict your patient’s clinical course.</li>
 	<li><strong>Perform ongoing patient evaluations - </strong>The quantitative nature of NeuroQuant will help you conduct longitudinal studies to track the rate of neurodegeneration in patients with atrophy due to Alzheimer’s, frontotemporal dementia, Corticobasal degeneration, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or traumatic brain injury.</li>
 	<li><strong>Streamline your MRI review- </strong>NeuroQuant's output provides you, the physician, with color-coded brain segmentation perfectly aligned to brain atlas, enabling closer inspection on a PACS or other DICOM viewer.  Review coronal, sagittal and axial findings using NeuroQuant reports that include example images.</li>
 	<li><strong>We're here to work with you. </strong>With clients from UCSD, Cedars-Sinai, Cleveland Clinic, Vanderbilt University, Duke University, Dent Neurologic Institute, and more than 150 other client sites, we at CorTechs Labs understand your desire as a doctor to best serve your patients, and we are willing to work with doctors to get NeuroQuant technology into local imaging centers.</li>
</ol>
