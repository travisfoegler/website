The CorTechs Labs Engineering team is very excited to announce the completion of two important scanner projects which will greatly benefit our customers by providing additional scanner options and higher patient throughput.

<strong>Toshiba Titan 3T Compatibility Expansion</strong>

Now, in addition to GE, Philips and Siemens 1.5 and 3.0 T scanners, NeuroQuant is also compatible with the Toshiba Titan 3T MRI scanners using MPower v3.5 software. Over the past few months, CorTechs Labs engineering team validated the Toshiba Titan 3T to ensure accurate and consistent brain segmentation results. The findings were impressive. The Toshiba 3T Titan showed excellent image quality and contrast allowing for accurate segmentation, and was found to be on par with other validated vendors.

The incorporation of the Toshiba 3T Titan into NeuroQuant scanner compatibility allows physicians and clinicians more freedom in MRI scanner choices when using <a href="http://www.cortechslabs.com/neuroquant">NeuroQuant 2.0</a> in their assessment of neurodegeneration.

<strong>Parallel Imaging for Faster Scan Times</strong>

Using the parallel imaging option can decrease typical scanning times by about 40% and now NeuroQuant supports the use of parallel imaging on the 3.0 T scanner models listed below.

Our engineers saw scanning times* drop from 6.5 minutes to &lt; 3 minutes. This decreased scanning time gives our customers the ability to scan more patients during the day!

These 3.0 T scanner models have been validated for use with NeuroQuant and shown to provide accurate and consistent segmentation as compared to a 3.0 T 3D T1 protocol without parallel imaging. The parallel imaging validation was performed and should only be used with <a href="http://www.cortechslabs/neuroquant">NeuroQuant 2.0</a>.
