He has set a goal to become fluent in Spanish by the end of the year. Estoy emocionado de ser bilingüe! Also, he hopes that every neurologist/radiologist who could benefit from a CorTechs Labs product has the opportunity use and see for themselves how their patient care is improved.

Professionally, Travis loves using technology to solve problems. He likes to observe how people use the internet and technology to communicate and how companies can naturally contribute and be influential in those spaces.

As the Digital Marketing Manager for CorTechs Labs, he is responsible for various online properties, including multiple public facing and internal use websites and applications. He tries to simplify the process in which potential customers engage while finding the information they need online to fully understand the functionality of our products and to make purchasing decisions.

Travis loves science and is happy to be working for a company dedicated to helping medical professionals provide the best care possible to their patients by quantifying subcortical brain structures, and identifying and monitoring brain lesions. He can see the power that this technology currently has and the potential for it to expand to aid in the treatment and diagnosis of diseases of the entire body.
