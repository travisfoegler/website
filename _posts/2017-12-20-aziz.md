As a longtime imaging scientist, he is interested in developing disease biomarkers using quantitative imaging means, which may be useful in diagnosis, as well as monitoring disease progression. At Cortechs Labs, Aziz spends his time on data analytics, scientific computing, and software design.

Although he is an originally east-coast person, Aziz is now convinced that the west-coast is the right coast. He enjoys the blue sky and hiking the San Diego canyons with his dog.
