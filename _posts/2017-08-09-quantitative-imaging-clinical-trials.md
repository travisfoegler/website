<a href="https://www.cortechslabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/contact-ipad.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3215 alignright" src="https://www.cortechslabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/contact-ipad-300x218.png" alt="" width="300" height="218" /></a>Quantitative volumetric brain analysis of medical images currently plays a pivotal role in selecting appropriate participants and in evaluating new therapies during clinical trials for neurodegenerative conditions, such as Alzheimer’s disease, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy and traumatic brain injury.

Recent studies have shown that when incorporated into clinical trials, quantitative imaging has the potential to reduce costs from drug development time by shortening clinical trial length, provide additional drug safety and efficacy data and potentially accelerate regulatory approvals.

Automated, quantitative imaging software from CorTechs Labs provides clinicians and researchers with fast, post-process imaging tools (<a href="http://www.cortechslabs.com/neuroquant">NeuroQuant</a>, <a href="http://www.cortechslabs.com/lesionquant">LesionQuant</a> and <a href="http://www.cortechslabs.com/petquant">PETQuant</a>) for ages 3 years to 100, which can be used in all stages of a clinical trial.

<strong>Participant Selection Criteria </strong>
By objectively measuring biomarkers that relate to the selection criteria for trial candidates, our quantitative imaging tools help reduce selection errors that could save time and money at the later stages of the trial.

<strong>During the Trial </strong>
Objective, consistent, and accurate measurements enable quantitative imaging software to reduce the subjectivity (human bias) and variability inherent in manual or other subjective quantification methods during the trial. Data is easily de-identified allowing patient privacy can be maintained without limiting the usability of the data.

<strong>Trial Endpoints</strong>
Using automatic and accurate measurements of brain structure volumes, researchers have access to disease-specific, non-invasive, <em>in vivo</em> quantitative MRI biomarkers to help quickly assess the impact a drug or other therapeutic interventions have on the brains of the participants.

<strong>Medical Device for Clinical Use
</strong>NeuroQuant is the first FDA 510(k) cleared, CE marked, and Health Canada, South Korea, and Australia licensed medical device software for quantitative analysis of MRI images of the human brain. LesionQuant is a module of the NeuroQuant software. PETQuant is available for research use only.

<strong>Data Analysis</strong>
Quickly and effortlessly visualize quantitative imaging trends and group behavior, as well as other uploaded data and variables with <a href="http://www.cortechslabs.com/trendworks">TrendWorks</a>, an analytical data analysis tool which complements CorTechs Labs products by providing an automatic import of NeuroQuant and LesionQuant data.

<strong>Partnership Opportunities</strong>
Many partnership opportunities exist with CorTechs Labs’ global (multicenter, multinational) network of hospitals, clinics and imaging centers to address the needs of clinical trials. With over 700 sites worldwide using CorTechs Labs software solutions, study coordinators can easily recruit and retain participants.
