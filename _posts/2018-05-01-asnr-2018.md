Are you interested in incorporating machine learning software and MR imaging biomarkers to quantify brain structures into your current clinical review for the detection and evaluation of neurodegenerative conditions?

Visit with CorTechs Labs at Booth 410 at ASNR in Vancouver, June 2-4, 2018, for a demo of our proven brain image analysis software and see for yourself how CorTechs Labs products can provide supportive information to physicians to aid in their clinical assessment, treatment planning and disease progression monitoring of patients.

<a href="http://discover.cortechslabs.com">CorTechs Labs</a>‘ automated solutions offer physicians and researchers the ability to easily examine volumetric imaging biomarkers, which can be helpful in the initial and ongoing evaluation of cognitive psychological, and/or behavioral impairments, seizure evaluation, and in monitoring lesion load.

Quantified brain structure measurements compared to age and gender matched normative reference data and color-coded brain structure images available quickly in your PACS or DICOM viewer:
<ul>
 	<li><a href="http://www.cortechslabs.com/neuroquant">NeuroQuant</a> - segmented brain structures and volumes, which can be used to assess brain volume loss in patients with neurodegenerative conditions, such as dementia, TBI, epilepsy, as well as, brain development</li>
 	<li><a href="http://www.cortechslabs.com/lesionquant">LesionQuant</a> –FLAIR lesions and brain structure volumes, which can be used to assess current lesions, lesion evolution and brain volume loss in patients with neurological conditions, such as MS</li>
 	<li><a href="http://www.cortechslabs.com/petquant">PETQuant</a> - FDG and Florbetapir radiotracing volumes in native patient brain space with PETQuant, which can be used to assess patients with neurodegenerative conditions, such as dementia</li>
</ul>
NeuroQuant and its LesionQuant module are FDA cleared, CE marked, and Health Canada, Korea, and Australia licensed for clinical use. PETQuant is for research use only.
