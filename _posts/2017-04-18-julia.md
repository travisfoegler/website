Julia sees a great potential to improve patient care through better data. Converting radiology images into data helps physicians provide better patient care and through her position at CorTechs Labs, she relishes contributing to this breakthrough trend.

As the Director of Product Management, Julia manages the CorTechs Labs cross-functional team to develop and expand products from initial idea through to commercialization with the focus on exceeding customer expectations, in addition to business needs. She uses her physics and technical background, as well as her extensive product management experience, to translate clinical needs and engineering ideas into successful products.

Outside of the office, she enjoys trying out new things. So far, she has completed an Ironman, home brewed beer and even tried her hand at creating pottery. Julia is a huge fan of living in San Diego with everything it has to offer, like exploring the San Diego Zoo and contemporary art museums, and visiting local craft breweries with her husband. She also has two crazy and incredibly cute rescue dogs.
