On Friday nights, you can find him at the drag strip, Saturdays at cars and coffee meet ups, and if there is a car show on Sunday, you’ll probably find him exhibiting his car. Put him behind the wheel or at the grip of a motorcycle handle, and he is the happiest man around.

Living at a fast pace, Luc loves keeping up to date with new technologies and research. CorTechs Labs is exactly that! The latest product, LesionQuant, fascinates him. He believes LesionQuant brings a 180 degree spin in helping Multiple Sclerosis patients. Luc says he is most impressed with the way LesionQuant reduces the time MS patients spend trying to understand their world and disease.

Luc’s has been in the IT industry since the 1990s.  Studying Physical Activities at Université du Québec in Canada, he quickly realized his passion, with technology as his calling.  A few certifications after, he was introduced into a world leading IT company and brought his knowledge and skills to a whole new level.  As a Technical Analyst at CorTechs Labs, Luc is a member of the support department.  His focus is to get you up to date with the latest technologies CorTechs Labs has to offer, so medical professionals can provide the best patient care possible.

Even though he’s a big guy, if you bring him chocolate, you will discover a very sweet and honest side of his personality.  He’s a giver, but he will not share his chocolate!  He keeps healthy playing basketball 2-3 times a week.  It is never too cold to spend time at the beach and read a book.  Ask him about his smart home!
