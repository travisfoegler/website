Ultimately, she'd like to see the current knowledge of science and medicine advance through the integration of body and mind; To help understand how the mind can assist in healing the body; To really utilize current eastern and western medicine together and integrate these knowledge bases with novel approaches to aging, health and medicine.</p>
Micki's primary job is Clinical Applications Specialist, where she assists clients with the more technical and clinical aspects of using CorTechs Labs products to their fullest extent. She also helps evaluate and improve brain segmentation algorithms, which provides information for product research and development. Micki has a radiology background with over 20 years of experience as a technologist, educator and applications specialist. She also has a masters degree in cognitive psychology which is a great adjunct to her radiology background. This unique combination gives me a great knowledge base for troubleshooting all types of customer issues, which is really fun.

Micki has been bodybuilding and studying the human mind for most of her life. She is fascinated with people, health and the mind. She is also a prolific reader, and is usually reading 3-4 books at one time. She also loves the ocean and all activities having to do with it, scuba diving, sailing, paddle boardingâ€¦
