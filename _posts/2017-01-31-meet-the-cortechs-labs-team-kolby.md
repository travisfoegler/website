<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-6147" src="https://www.cortechslabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Kolby-230x300.jpg" alt="" width="230" height="300" />Kolby's ultimate goal is to make a positive difference in others peoples’ lives. She is committed to a healthy and balanced lifestyle - one in which she never stops learning, continuously challenges her, and forces her to step outside of her comfort zone to ultimately become the greatest version of herself.

Kolby is the Operations, Sales and Marketing Coordinator for CorTechs Labs. She is responsible for directing and managing various projects related to operational processes, sales and marketing efforts, as well as accounting needs.

She received a BS in Human Biology and a minor in Psychology from the University of California, San Diego and plans to go back to school to receive her Masters in the sciences sometime in the near future.

If she isn’t at work or at home, you can probably find Kolby in the gym, where she usually spends about 15 hours (!!) a week. She is 100% percent addicted to caffeine, coffee, and chocolate, and is thankful that you cannot overdose on chicken because she eats a ton of it. She also loves sunflowers and wishes they smelled as pretty as they look. She absolutely loves when she gets to cross tasks off of the many and, sometimes, redundant lists that she makes.

Kolby feels extremely fortunate to be able to work in an industry and for a company that positively impacts patient lives on a daily basis by way of advanced technologies.
