Brain trauma typically occurs when there has been an injury to the head, which can be caused by falling or crashing into another person or objects while participating in winter sports. These types of accidents can lead to head injuries like concussions and traumatic brain injury. Winter sports brain traumas are in the top 10 of the highest number of estimated head injuries treated in U.S. hospital emergency rooms. In 2009, the Consumer Product Safety Commission estimated that over 20,000 reported emergency room visits were from winter sports and this number is thought to increase every year.

Recently, we wrote about chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a progressive degenerative brain disease typically seen in athletes who have a history of repetitive brain trauma (concussions and subconcussions). CTE is a concern for winter sports athletes, as well. You can read that post <span style="color: #c8042c;"><a style="color: #c8042c;" href="/concussion-movie">here.</a></span>

Preventive measures, such as correctly fitted helmets and other protective head equipment, can help winter sports participants avoid concussions and TBIs. If a concussion or TBI is suspected, it is important to take and keep the injured person out of play until he/she has been thoroughly evaluated by an experienced medical care professional and given permission to return to play.

The <a href="https://www.cortechslabs.com/neuroquant/tba/"><span style="color: #c8042c;">NeuroQuant Triage Brain Atrophy Report</span></a> can be used by physicians in their assessment of brain trauma. NeuroQuant is the first FDA cleared and CE marked medical device software that helps physicians detect and measure changes in brain structures, which could occur in a brain injury. The <a href="https://www.cortechslabs.com/neuroquant/tba/"><span style="color: #c8042c;">Triage Brain Atrophy report</span></a> is available for ages 3 to 100 and provides volume measurements of 39 brain structures separated in right and left hemisphere and sorted by lobe and region.Â <span class="hs_cos_wrapper hs_cos_wrapper_meta_field hs_cos_wrapper_type_rich_text">NeuroQuant is an accurate and proven software tool that provides quantitative measurements to aid in clinical assessments of brain anatomy after injury.</span>
