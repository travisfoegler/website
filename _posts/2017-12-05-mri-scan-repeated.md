It is actually uncommon for a patient to require a repeat MRI scan in order to produce a NeuroQuant report.

NeuroQuant software is extremely sophisticated -  it can process a array of exams.  However, there are some circumstances that do require a repeat.

<strong>Situations where repeating the MRI scan may be useful:</strong>
<ol>
 	<li>Patient motion during the scan</li>
 	<li>Contrast agents given to the patient prior to the NeuroQuant series being run</li>
 	<li>Incorrect scan parameters *</li>
 	<li>Incorrect landmark – The landmark must be +- 100mm from glabella. This occurs most often when a double study is performed brain and c-spine. It is critical to re-establish the glabellar landmark as isocenter prior to acquiring the NeuroQuant volumetric scan.</li>
 	<li>Other MR acquisition image artifacts</li>
</ol>
<strong>Situations where repeating the MRI scan will not be worthwhile:</strong>
<ol>
 	<li>Alignment of brain to atlas unsuccessful because MI is &gt; 5 unless there are significant motion artifacts or the patient was severely misaligned in the scanner</li>
 	<li>Patients with gross structural abnormalities, including extreme atrophy</li>
 	<li>Patients with surgical resections</li>
 	<li>Patients with tumors and implants</li>
</ol>
*NeuroQuant software is intended for use only with specifically defined MRI acquisition sequences. Deviation from the recommended acquisition protocols can affect the quality of the results.
