<a href="https://www.cortechslabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/David.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-7192 alignright" src="https://www.cortechslabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/David.jpg" alt="" width="152" height="217" /></a>David’s goals are to speak 4 languages, live where he can walk to his own surf spot, own a ranch with many different types of animals including horses, birds and cows, complete at least 5 music albums, and meet aliens.

David enjoyed all things science growing up. He developed that interest into a Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics from UCSD and a career at CorTechs Labs, where he is the resident Systems Administrator and go-to-guy for anything infrastructure related. He thrives on completing technological puzzles and is extremely proud to work for a company invested in improving medical processes and patient care via life-saving MRI technology.

David hopes that one day imaging scan times and costs will be reduced until the point that present and future neurological disorders can be much better understood and one day cured.

Away from his desk, this San Diego native finds his happiness in the water, most often at undisclosed locations along the San Diego and Baja coastlines. David is a surfer, and extremely passionate about conservation on land and sea. He is also an experimental music and noise recordist with over 100 tracks and counting.
