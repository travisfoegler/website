<p style="text-align: left;"><img style="width: 119px; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px; float: right;" src="https://www.cortechslabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/DrJamesBrewer.jpg?t=1486616743416&amp;width=119&amp;name=DrJamesBrewer.jpg" alt="DrJamesBrewer.jpg" width="119" />Dr. Brewer is the Chief Medical Advisor for CorTechs Labs and was the first physician to incorporate NeuroQuant® into clinical practice. He assisted in the design of the NeuroQuant reports and in the studies that led to NeuroQuant’s FDA clearance in 2006.</p>
In 2004, he joined the faculty of the University of California, San Diego, where he has a joint appointment in Radiology and Neurosciences. Dr. Brewer sees patients at the University of California, San Diego and the Veterans Affairs Hospital in La Jolla.

Dr. Brewer's primary research interest is human memory. He uses functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to study memory processes in volunteers with healthy memory and in patients with memory impairment, such as cases caused by Alzheimer's disease (AD).

Dr. Brewer received his graduate and medical training at Stanford University and his neurology residency training at Johns Hopkins University.

In the webinar below, Dr. Brewer shares his experience using NeuroQuant, and gives an overview how NeuroQuant can help physicians improve their assessment of neurodegenerative disease, such as Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, as well brain trauma and brain development.
