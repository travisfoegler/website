During the year, we experienced remarkable growth in our business, added many significant new customers and expanded our strategic business partnerships.

With over 100,000 brains analyzed using <span style="color: #c8042c;"><a style="color: #c8042c;" href="http://www.cortechslabs.com/neuroquant">NeuroQuant</a></span>, it is exciting to watch the growth indicating an increased acceptance and realized importance of using quantitative imaging for the assessment of neurological disorders. During 2015, we established NeuroQuant as the most proven and most accurate quantitative imaging solutions and enjoyed worldwide support within hospitals, universities, radiology centers, clinical and research practices and military hospitals. These facilities see and understand the value of NeuroQuant's volumetric measurements of subcortical structures aiding in the assessment of a variety of clinical disciplines, from dementia, through epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injuries and brain development.

In the middle of 2015 we released <a href="/neuroquant_upgrade"><span style="color: #c8042c;">NeuroQuant 2.0</span></a>, providing significant additions and improvements, among them, new and improved output reports for ages 3 years to 100, the advanced <a href="/dynamic-atlas"><span style="color: #c8042c;">Dynamic Atlas™</span></a> segmentation and registration technology, increased accuracy and precision of brain segmentation, and operating system independence. Toward the end of 2015, we expanded NeuroQuant 2.0 to include productivity enhancing capabilities such as the use of <span style="color: #c8042c;"><a style="color: #c8042c;" href="/neuroquant-scanner">parallel imaging</a></span> on GE, Philips and Siemens 3.0 T scanners, providing faster scan times, the addition of <span style="color: #c8042c;"><a style="color: #c8042c;" href="/neuroquant-scanner">Toshiba Titan 3T</a></span> scanner compatibility and <a href="/powerscribe-360"><span style="color: #c8042c;">PowerScribe 360</span></a> integration.

With these expanded capabilities NeuroQuant continues to be the paramount solution for the assessment of neurological conditions. From brain development to Alzheimer’s, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy and brain trauma, NeuroQuant helps enhance the quality of patient care. As always, <span style="color: #c8042c;"><a style="color: #c8042c;" href="http://www.cortechslabs.com/contact/">we welcome feedback</a></span> and ideas for improvement from anybody that wants to share it with us.

2015 was a great year, and we are thrilled to see what unfolds for 2016. Stay tuned - more exciting developments are happening and we look forward to sharing them with you!
