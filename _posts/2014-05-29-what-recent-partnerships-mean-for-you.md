Recently, we posted the <a href="http://cortechsnews.cortechslabs.com/the-top-5-reasons-to-use-neuroquant">Top 5 Reasons you Should Use NeuroQuant®</a>.  We're not going to take those back, but with our new partnerships we are giving you more reasons to follow CorTechs Labs and use NeuroQuant.  Here are three more:
<ol>
 	<li><strong>New marketing agreement with GE Healthcare</strong>. As a leading provided of MRI systems, GE Healthcare recognizes the value of accurate, quantitative brain imaging software. As a result, this strategic, co-marketing agreement will bring together the power of GE Healthcare and innovation of CorTechs Labs in an effort to make NeuroQuant the "standard measurement solution for all brain disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis and traumatic brain injury". <a href="http://www.genewscenter.com/Press-Releases/GE-Healthcare-and-CorTechs-Labs-Inc-Announce-Strategic-Agreement-to-Co-Market-NeuroQuant-Comprehe-470b.aspx?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter">Read more.</a></li>
 	<li><strong>Innovative approaches with Human Longevity, Inc. (HLI)  </strong>With a focus on extending the healthy, high performance human life span, with expertise in genomics and cell therapy-based diagnostic company, HLI has partnered with CorTechs as their quantitative imaging partner.“HLI’s goal is to revolutionize healthcare using the most advanced tools available for predicting, preventing, and treating disease, and imaging is a critical component for this,” said Dr. Venter, Co-founder and CEO of HLI. <a href="http://www.humanlongevity.com/cortechs-labs-and-human-longevity-inc-to-collaborate-on-comprehensive-diagnostics-by-combining-deep-sequencing-with-quantitative-imaging/">Read more. </a></li>
 	<li><strong>Our partnership with NordicNeuroLab.</strong> Brain imaging is needed all around the world, not just in the United States.  By creating this partnership with NNL, we can expand distribution in Europe, making NeuroQuant available for more patients and physicians. The CEO of NNL, Fredrik Isdal, is convinced that “the consistent and accurate data provided in NeuroQuant’s reports is a vital component in the assessment of neurodegenerative disease – such as Alzheimer’s, Epilepsy, TBI and Multiple Sclerosis.” <a href="http://www.cortechslabs.com/cortechs-labs-and-nordic-neurolab-announce-distribution-neuroquant-sales-in-europe/">Read more.</a></li>
</ol>
We're not done yet, more to come in the next few months.  If you'd like to stay current on CorTechs and our partners, follow us on Facebook, Twitter, or ask to join our <a href="http://www.cortechslabs.com/contact/">mailing list</a> .  In June we will launch version 1.4 of NeuroQuant, more details to come.
