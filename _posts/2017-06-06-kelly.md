She is excited about exponential developments in science and technology and is eager to see how these new ideas will impact our day-to-day lives, and considers herself lucky to be part of a team that can utilize technological innovation to help change lives across the globe.

Kelly’s background is in of Cognitive Neuroscience research, where she worked with structural, functional, and diffusion MRI. She is also trained to administer a variety of neuropsychological tests. Kelly enjoys learning all about the brain, and has worked with many patient groups, including children with autism, patients with Temporal Lobe Epilepsy, and patients with Primary Brain Tumors.

As the Neuroanatomy Imaging Specialist at CorTechs Labs, Kelly spends a lot of time looking at brains. She helps evaluate and improve brain segmentation algorithms, and provides invaluable information for product research and development.

While completing a Master’s degree in Cognitive Neuropsychology and Rehabilitation at the University of Birmingham in England, Kelly managed to see the Queen of England and the royal family on three different occasions. A major feat! Despite her love of brains, Kelly is not a fan of zombie movies, but she loves to read science fiction and fantasy novels. Kelly obsessed with French fries and animals. She would love to open a rescue someday. For animals, not French fries.
