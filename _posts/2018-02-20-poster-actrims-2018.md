<strong>CorTechs Labs was pleased to have this UC San Diego School of Medicine poster presented at ACTRIMS Forum 2018</strong>

Automated quantitative measures from MRI, such as lesion volume and distribution, have significant value for clinicians evaluating disease progression. Clinical standards for lesion evaluation include visual inspection of MRI images, or expert manual segmentation of lesions. These subjective measurements lack standardization and reproducibility in clinical settings

CorTechs Labs’ LesionQuant module is a fully-automated lesion segmentation tool for clinical use designed to provide accurate and reproducible lesion segmentations. This study demonstrates that automated segmentation of MS lesion volumes and counts by LesionQuant provides reproducible results that correlate well with expert manual counts and analysis.
