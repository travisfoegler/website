2014 was an amazing year at CorTechs Labs. We experienced remarkable growth in all aspects of the company and added many significant hospitals, clinics, universities, imaging service facilities and military bases as customers. I want to warmly thank you for using NeuroQuant in your clinical and research practices.

In my role as the CEO of CorTechs Labs, I get many opportunities to speak with a range of customers - from the neurology and neuroradiology heads of the largest hospitals and clinics, to the smallest imaging services facilities, in the US and in Europe. It is always a great opportunity for me to get a first-hand impression of the state-of-the-art trends in radiology and neurology and to sense the reality and daily challenges of providing imaging healthcare services.

What I have learned this year is that quantitative imaging is getting acceptance in clinical practice and that measuring sub-cortical brain volumes and comparing them to normative values has clinical application in a growing number of clinical disciplines, from dementia, through epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injuries and a variety of pediatric disorders.

Armed with great customer feedback and with growth momentum, we are getting ready to improve NeuroQuant even further to keep its leading position in the T1-weighted quantitative imaging market. This year NeuroQuant customer will enjoy a much broader set of reports highlighting more brain volumes that are relevant to the above clinical disciplines.  Additionally, we will further improve scan/re-scan accuracy, computational performance and the support of additional platforms such as Windows and Linux.

As usual, we always look for feedback and ideas for improvement and we welcome anybody that wants to share it with us.

I would like to invite you to our website (<a href="http://www.cortechslabs.com">www.cortechslabs.com</a>) where you will find a wealth of information and scientific publications relevant to quantitative imaging.

Whether you are looking to learn and educate yourself about quantitative neuroimaging, or if you want to hear how to use it in clinical practice - we can help. Feel free to contact us.

CEO
