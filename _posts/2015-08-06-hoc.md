In managing patients with neurodegenerative diseases predicting the progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an important factor. Approximately 10-15% of all patients diagnosed with MCI will develop Alzheimer’s disease annually.

In recent studies<sup>§</sup>, a new biomarker was identified that helps in the prediction of progression. The hippocampal occupancy score (HOC) is a biomarker highly associated with the progression. The HOC is a measurement of the mesial temporal lobe atrophy and combines information from the hippocampus volumes and inferior lateral ventricle volumes. The equation looks as follows:

HOC is an estimate of mesial temporal lobe atrophy based on inferior lateral ventricle expansion. It is calculated as the ratio of hippocampal volume to the sum of the hippocampal and ILV volumes in each hemisphere separately, which are then averaged and normalized for age and gender.

The updated <a href="http://www.cortechslabs.com/neuroquant/age">Age Related Atrophy report</a> in NeuroQuant 2.0 now includes the HOC as one of the parameters. It shows the HOC normalized to intra cranial volume and compares it to healthy patients of the same age and gender.
