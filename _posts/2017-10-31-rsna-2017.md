<a href="https://www.cortechslabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/team-icon-2.png"><img class=" wp-image-7475 alignright" src="https://www.cortechslabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/team-icon-2.png" alt="" width="221" height="289" /></a>Several biomarkers are available for the early detection and evaluation of neurodegenerative diseases from MRIs, specifically for the assessment of diminishing cognitive abilities from dementia and brain trauma, as well as isolating hippocampal sclerosis or confirming hippocampal asymmetry. Similarly, assessment of disease activity on MRIs from new and enlarging T2 FLAIR lesions and whole and regional brain volumes is an integral component of multiple sclerosis (MS) management.

<a href="http://discover.cortechslabs.com">CorTechs Labs</a>' automated solutions offer physicians and researchers the ability to examine volumetric imaging biomarkers, which can be used in the initial and ongoing evaluation of cognitive psychological, and/or behavioral impairments, seizure evaluation, and in monitoring lesion load.

Visit us at Booth 3950 at RSNA in Chicago, November 26-29, 2017, for a demo of our proven brain image analysis software, which can provide supportive information to physicians to aid in their clinical assessment, treatment planning and disease progression monitoring of patients.

In addition to quickly delivering accurate quantified brain structure measurements compared to age and gender matched normative reference data, CorTechs Labs products also provide color-coded segmented brains structure images for easy review in PACS or DICOM viewer.

NeuroQuant and its LesionQuant module are FDA cleared, CE marked, and Health Canada, Korea and Australia licensed for clinical use. PETQuant is for research use only.
