</ul>
<strong>Overview:</strong>
Dr. Albright will examine how CorTechs Labs’ LesionQuant can support clinicians in clinical treatment planning and disease progression monitoring of patients with neurodegenerative diseases, such as MS, by providing valuable quantitative lesion evolution and brain structure data.

The LesionQuant module of NeuroQuant (FDA cleared/CE marked) can assist physicians in their clinical evaluation process, clinical treatment planning and monitoring of disease progression by combining T2 FLAIR with 3D T1 scans for quantitative lesion analysis. It automatically visualizes lesions and lesion volume changes and provides longitudinal changes brain structure volumes.
