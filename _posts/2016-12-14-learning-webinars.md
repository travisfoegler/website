Our FDA cleared (2006), CE marked (2014) and Health Canada licensed (2016) tools provide physicians with crucial quantitative measurements that can help in evaluating brain volume loss in patients with neurological conditions, such as Alzheimer’s disease, MS, brain trauma, epilepsy and more.

Brain atrophy, measured as brain volume loss on MRI, occurs naturally with aging, but in patients with neurological disease, brain volume loss may occur at a quicker pace. Additionally, brain atrophy has been associated with cognitive impairment and disability.

To help medical professionals learn more about how CorTechs Labs products can provide quantitative measurements from MRI brain studies, which can be used in conjunction with other clinical findings as part of their clinical assessment, we have hosted a series of webinars. You can watch them at your leisure by clicking the links below.
