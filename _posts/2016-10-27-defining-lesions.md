Here, we summarize LesionQuant’s FLAIR brain lesion count, volume and distribution classification and definitions.

LesionQuant defines lesions as areas of increased FLAIR MRI signal intensity above a set threshold when compared to the surrounding tissue.

Areas greater than or equal to 4 voxels will be considered a lesion.

Lesion burden is calculated by taking the total volume of lesions compared to total white matter volume. This provides the ratio of brain volume identified as lesion in contrast to healthy white matter.

LesionQuant provides lesion volume (cm<sup>3</sup>), count and percent of intracranial volume for all lesions, and is further classified into total lesions, new lesions and enlarging lesions.
<ul>
 	<li>Total lesions encompass all current, new, and enlarging lesions</li>
 	<li>New lesions are defined as areas of intensity that were not present in previous scan images.</li>
 	<li>Enlarging lesions are defined as lesions which were present in prior scan images, and have increased by 20% from the prior scan images.</li>
 	<li>Touching lesions are counted as one lesion.</li>
</ul>
For anatomical distribution classification:
<ul>
 	<li>A lesion that touches the surface of a ventricle is labeled as periventricular</li>
 	<li>If a lesion is touching gray matter, it is labeled leukocortical</li>
 	<li>Lesions in and touching the brain stem and cerebellum are labeled infratentorial</li>
 	<li>All remaining white matter lesions are labeled as deep white</li>
</ul>
