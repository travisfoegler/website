His career goal is to advance the technologies driving quantitative image analysis, as well as the methodologies in data analytics for creating accurate and meaningful information.

As the Principal Scientist, Weidong leads the research and development of CorTechs Labs’ imaging science technologies. With a continuing focus on standardizing MRI data for quantitative imaging, Weidong aims to optimize data acquisition protocols and reduce the bias and errors in MRI data, so that analytical software can produce more accurate and consistent results. He also manages data analytics by implementing descriptive and predictive statistical modeling methods. For example, to create normative model for clinicians to better identify the anomalies. In addition, he creates predictive models based on results from quantitative analysis for various projects.

Weidong enjoys living in beautiful San Diego and tries to fully takes advantage of the city’s unbelievable weather. You can often find him biking with friends along the coast or hiking at the trails with his kids. Occasionally, he works as a freelance photographer. Although many of his co-workers have attempted to challenge him, Weidong remains the ongoing current ping pong champion at CorTechs Labs for two years straight!
