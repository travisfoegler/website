Over the past few months, we have explored several factors which can degrade the technical quality of MR images or pathologic processes, and significantly affect neuroanatomic structure, which may decrease the accuracy of <span style="color: #c8042c;"><a style="color: #c8042c;" href="http://www.cortechslabs.com/neuroquant">NeuroQuant® </a></span>output.

Below is a compilation of those posts for an easy review:
<h4><a href="/contrast-agents">Case Study: NeuroQuant Does Not Require Contrast Agents to Achieve the Image Quality Necessary for Image Post-Processing</a></h4>
Contrast agents are typically used to study vasculature, something that is not needed for volumetric MR imaging. <span style="color: #666666;">NeuroQuant</span> requires a non-contrasted, 3D T1 sagittal sequence to segment and measure brain structure volumes. <span style="color: #c8042c;"><a style="color: #c8042c;" href="/contrast-agents">Read post</a></span>.

<h4><a href="/alignment-to-atlas">Case Study: Good Alignment to Atlas for NeuroQuant Accuracy</a></h4>
Alignment to atlas is an important step in NeuroQuant's analysis process. To achieve its high quality segmentation results, NeuroQuant aligns each patient's brain image to an atlas of the brain. <span style="color: #c8042c;"><a style="color: #c8042c;" href="/alignment-to-atlas">Read post.</a></span>

<h4><a href="/neuroquant-processing-errors">Case Study: How to Ensure Accurate NeuroQuant Processing Results</a></h4>
Patients who have shunts, implants or other artifacts or inherent abnormalities, can potentially generate segmentation misregistration. To prevent such errors and protect the accuracy of the results, NeuroQuant prevents analysis when such artifacts or anatomical anomalies are present. <span style="color: #c8042c;"><a style="color: #c8042c;" href="/neuroquant-processing-errors">Read post.</a></span>

<h4><a href="/3d-t1-sequences">Case Study: The Importance of Processing a 3D T1 Sequence for NeuroQuant</a></h4>
3D T1 sagittal MRIs are needed to obtain ideal brain morphometry for volume analysis. In order to achieve its high quality segmentation results, NeuroQuant has been optimized for processing 3D T1 sagittal MRI acquisition sequence in 1.5 and 3.0T closed scanners. <span style="color: #c8042c;"><a style="color: #c8042c;" href="/3d-t1-sequences">Read post</a></span>.

<h4><a href="/patient-positioning">Case Study: The Importance of Patient Positioning for Accurate NeuroQuant Analysis</a></h4>
If a sequence is acquired and uploaded to NeuroQuant with any of the X, Y or Z coordinates outside +/-100mm, automated volumetric analysis cannot be performed. An NeuroQuant error message will be returned. <span style="color: #c8042c;"><a style="color: #c8042c;" href="/patient-positioning">Read post.</a></span>
