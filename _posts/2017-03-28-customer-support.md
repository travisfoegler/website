<strong>Do you have a technical question or support need?</strong>
The CorTechs Labs Support Team is available Monday through Friday from 7 AM to 5 PM PT at +1 (858) 459-9700 ext. 2.

Emailing <a href="mailto:support@cortechslabs.com">support@cortechslabs.com</a> is the easiest and best way to reach the CorTechs Labs Support Team during and after hours. If you send your email directly to a specific team member, he/she could be busy assisting another customer, and responses may be delayed.

<strong>To streamline and accelerate your support process, we’ve put together a few tips and tricks.
</strong>In the body of your email, please include as much of the following as possible:
<ul>
 	<li>A detailed description of the problem, including any error messages or screenshots</li>

 	<li>The system you are using to process your product, either online or installed</li>
 	<li>MRN or PatientID and scan date (if you are having issues with a particular scan on the <em>online system</em>)</li>
 	<li>Your NeuroQuant login name, if known</li>
 	<li>Your site name</li>
 	<li>Your name and contact information</li>
</ul>
<strong>Depending on the question or issue, we will either email or call you back.
</strong>If you think we might need to remotely access your system, please have the following ready for when we email or call back for more information:
<ul>
 	<li>TeamViewer ID and password, other remote desktop software or VPN connectivity info, as applicable</li>
</ul>
<strong>We are always here to help!</strong>
