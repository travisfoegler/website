<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>AAN</strong> (Boston, April 23-26), Booth 324
Poster (April 26): Performance Evaluation for Automated Lesion Segmentation Tool: LesionQuant</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>ASNR</strong> (Long Beach, CA, April 24-26), Booth 425</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>ISMRM </strong>(Hawaii, April 22-24), Posters
E-Poster (April 25, Exhibition Hall): Accuracy and Reproducibility of an Automated Lesion Segmentation Tool - LesionQuant
Traditional Poster (April 26, Exhibition Hall): Homomorphic Determination of Noise Variance and Denoising Using a Non-Local Means Filter for Assessing the Accuracy of Automated Segmentation</p>
Let us provide you with additional information by visiting our booths or poster session at one of the upcoming conferences:
<ul>
 	<li>Discover how to support your clinical impression with<strong> fully automated, fast, accurate and proven</strong> MR image segmentation and volumetric analysis for ages 3 to 100 years.</li>
 	<li><strong>Gain more insight into</strong> <strong>your patient’s clinical course</strong> when evaluating brain volume loss which may be due to Alzheimer’s, frontotemporal dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or traumatic brain injury.</li>
 	<li>Practice evidenced-based medicine using<strong> NeuroQuant</strong> to derive meaningful, numeric datafrom MRI scans which can help provide evidence of tissue damage and pathology.</li>
 	<li>Add comprehensive FLAIR lesion segmentation and visualization with <strong>LesionQuant,</strong> a NeuroQuant product, volumetric lesion and brain structure analysis to aid in evaluation and disease progression monitoring.</li>
 	<li>Quantify subregional tracer (FDG and Florbetapir) binding in native brain space in PET brain studies with <strong>PETQuant</strong>, a research use only volumetric analysis for assessing neurodegenerative dementias.</li>
 	<li>Enhance your analysis of large volumes of NeuroQuant data, discover trends and explore individual data points within study results with <strong>TrendWorks analytics.</strong></li>
</ul>
We are excited to see new and old faces <strong>and discuss and demonstrate the benefits of our automated brain image analysis products first hand! </strong>Schedule a meeting with us below. See you soon!
