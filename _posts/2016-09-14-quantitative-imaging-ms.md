We are very excited to once again be a part of this international event for advancing MS care and research.

Visit us at Stand D08 to learn more about LesionQuant, our fast, accurate and automated FLAIR lesion and brain volume measurement, as well as, lesion visualization solution. <span style="color: #c8042c;"><a style="color: #c8042c;" href="http://www.cortechslabs.com/lesionquant">LesionQuant</a></span>, a NeuroQuant product, provides valuable, enriching, quantitative data on brain structures and lesions, providing supportive information to physicians to aid in their clinical treatment planning and disease progression monitoring of patients with white matter diseases, such as Multiple Sclerosis.

Below is a compilation of a few blog posts which discuss how physicians can use quantitative imaging to evaluate the brain structure and lesion volumes in patients with MS, and track longitudinal trends.

<span style="color: #c8042c;"><a style="color: #c8042c;" href="/neuroquant-now-with-flair">NeuroQuant, Now with FLAIR</a></span>
An introduction to LesionQuant: A notable enhancement to NeuroQuant, which combines the information from 3D T1 and 2D or 3D FLAIR MRI imaging to provide fast, quality lesion segmentation, quantification, and visualization, in addition to brain structure volume measurements.

<span style="color: #c8042c;"><a style="color: #c8042c;" href="/flair-lesion-visualization">FLAIR Lesion Visualization with LesionQuant</a></span>
LesionQuant's FLAIR lesion overlay provides physicians two different DICOM files for an easy slice-by-slice review: FLAIR lesion segmentation and FLAIR lesion change.

<span style="color: #c8042c;"><a style="color: #c8042c;" href="/multiple-sclerosis">Living with Hope: Multiple Sclerosis</a></span>
Review of thought-provoking information about the use of volumetric MRIs for prognosis and drug treatment decisions in patients with MS.

<span style="color: #c8042c;"><a style="color: #c8042c;" href="/multiple-sclerosis-neurodegeneration">2016 Brain Awareness Week Focus: Multiple Sclerosis and Neurodegeneration</a></span>
Discussion in light of increasing information that MS has two major contributors, inflammation and neurodegeneration.

<span style="color: #c8042c;"><a style="color: #c8042c;" href="/volumetric-neuroimaging-ms">The Role of Volumetric Neuroimaging in the Evaluation of Multiple Sclerosis</a></span>
Examination of incorporating automated volumetric MR imaging to extend brain atrophy measurements to the routine management of MS patients by showing regional and whole brain atrophy, which can be monitored over time.

<span style="color: #c8042c;"><a style="color: #c8042c;" href="/multi-time-points">Did You Know? You Can Display Multi Time Points
</a><span style="color: #666666;"><span style="color: #c8042c;"><a style="color: #c8042c;" href="http://www.cortechslabs.com/neuroquant">NeuroQuant</a></span> provides a multi time point feature, which can be used by physicians to assess volume change trends in brain structures, as it displays the results of follow-up measurements together with all previous measurements.</span></span>
