Visit us at Booth 1113 at AAN in Los Angeles, April 22-25, 2018, for a demo of our proven and objective brain image analysis software. See for yourself how CorTechs Labs products can add supportive quantitative brain structure and lesion data to supplement your clinical review.

<a href="http://discover.cortechslabs.com">CorTechs Labs</a>â€˜ automated solutions offer physicians and researchers the ability to easily examine in vivo volumetric imaging biomarkers, which can be helpful in the initial and ongoing evaluation of cognitive psychological, and/or behavioral impairments, seizure evaluation, and in monitoring lesion load.
<ul>
 	<li>Quantified measurements of segmentable brain structures with <a href="https://www.cortechslabs.com/neuroquant">NeuroQuant</a></li>
 	<li>Quantified measurements of FLAIR lesions and brain structures with <a href="https://www.cortechslabs.com/lesionquant">LesionQuant</a></li>
 	<li>Quantified measurements of FDG and Florbetapir radiotracing in native patient brain space with <a href="https://www.cortechslabs.com/petquant">PETQuant</a></li>
</ul>
In addition to quickly delivering accurate quantified brain structure measurements compared to age and gender matched normative reference data, CorTechs Labs products also provide color-coded segmented brains structure images for easy review in PACS or DICOM viewer. Non-invasive, NeuroQuant and LesionQuant can be ordered in conjunction with a standard brain study MRI.

NeuroQuant and its LesionQuant module are FDA cleared, CE marked, and Health Canada, Korea, and Australia licensed for clinical use. PETQuant is for research use only.
