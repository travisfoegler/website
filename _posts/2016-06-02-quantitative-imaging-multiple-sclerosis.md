<img style="width: 293px; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px; float: right;" title="MS_image.png" src="http://cortechsnews.cortechslabs.com/hubfs/MS_image.png?t=1486616743416" alt="MS_image.png" />This week, we are exhibiting at the Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centers (CMSC) 2016 Annual Meeting. We are very excited to be a part of their 30th anniversary celebration, marking 30 years of advancing MS care and research.

Visit us at Booth 707 to learn more about our fast, accurate and proven automated brain image analysis solutions, which provide valuable, quantitative brain structure measurements to aid in the assessment of neurological conditions, including MS.

Previously, we have written a few blog posts which discuss how physicians can use quantitative imaging to evaluate the brain volumes in patients with MS, and track longitudinal trends. The <span style="color: #c8042c;"><a style="color: #c8042c;" href="http://www.cortechslabs.com/neuroquant/msa">NeuroQuant Multi Structure Atrophy report </a></span>provides volume measurements for nine brain structures, including the whole brain, white and gray matter, and thalamus, and compares the values to NeuroQuant norms, allowing NeuroQuant to deliver a precise indication of where that individual's brain structure volumes lie within an age- and gender-based reference chart.

Below is a compilation of those posts for an easy review:

<span style="color: #c8042c;"><a style="color: #c8042c;" href="/multiple-sclerosis">Living with Hope: Multiple Sclerosis</a></span>
Review of thought-provoking information about the use of volumetric MRIs for prognosis and drug treatment decisions in patients with MS.

Discussion in light of increasing information that MS has two major contributors, inflammation and neurodegeneration.

Examination of incorporating automated volumetric MR imaging to extend brain atrophy measurements to the routine management of MS patients by showing regional and whole brain atrophy, which can be monitored over time.

</a><span style="color: #666666;"><a style="color: #666666;" href="http://www.cortechslabs.com/neuroquant">NeuroQuant®</a> provides a multi time point feature, which can be used by physicians to assess volume change trends in brain structures, as it displays the results of follow-up measurements together with all previous measurements.</span></span>
