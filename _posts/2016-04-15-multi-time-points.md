<span style="color: #c8042c;"><a style="color: #c8042c;" href="http://www.cortechslabs.com/neuroquant">NeuroQuantÂ®</a></span> provides a multi time point feature, which can be used by physicians to assess volume change trends in brain structures, as it displays the results of follow-up measurements together with all previous measurements. This feature provides physicians with additional information for ongoing patient evaluation.

The multi time point feature eliminates the need to review several different reports at once, allowing physicians to quickly and easily assess volume change trends in brain structures. The multi time point feature is available on the <span style="color: #c8042c;"><a style="color: #c8042c;" href="http://www.cortechslabs.com/neuroquant/age">Age Related Atrophy</a></span>, <span style="color: #c8042c;"><a style="color: #c8042c;" href="http://www.cortechslabs.com/neuroquant/asym">Hippocampal Volume Asymmetry</a></span>, <span style="color: #c8042c;"><a style="color: #c8042c;" href="http://www.cortechslabs.com/neuroquant/msa">Multi Structure Atrophy</a></span> and <span style="color: #c8042c;"><a style="color: #c8042c;" href="http://www.cortechslabs.com/neuroquant/bd">Brain Development </a></span>reports.

The multi time point feature displays the volume of brain structures at multiple time intervals based on patient scan dates. This information is provided in the same report, with the previous measurements colored in gray and the most current measurement in black.

The case study images below are from the same patient taken over 3 years and demonstrate the benefit of using the multi time point feature.
<ul>
 	<li>Looking at the individual single time point results, it is challenging for physicians to assess if there is any volume change between the scan dates.</li>
 	<li>With the multi time point feature compiling the single time point results on to the most recent report, physicians can assess volume change trends in brain structures quickly and easily.</li>
</ul>

Please review the following, to ensure that the multi time points are displayed when processing NeuroQuant reports:
<ul>
 	<li>For patients that have been scanned in NeuroQuant 2.0
<ul>
 	<li>The previous scan will already be in the system, the multi time point will be created automatically</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>For patients that have been scanned in a previous version of NeuroQuant (1.4 or before) and not scanned in NeuroQuant 2.0
<ul>
 	<li>The source DICOM data needs to be sent to NeuroQuant for processing in version 2.0</li>
 	<li>Then, the current NeuroQuant sequence can be processed and the multi time point will be created</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
