Welcome to CorTechs Labs and our new brand.  This new presentation of our company and our remarkable products and services will provide an enhanced client experience.  CorTechs Labs has recently experienced a robust transition to meet the needs of the rapidly expanding client base.  Experienced and innovative leadership has been assembled to embark on a dynamic new mission.  The corporate headquarters has moved to enjoy a position in one of the most unique and contemporary medical device and biotech corridors in the world. There is so much more on the horizon as product features continue to be developed and client relationships evolve and expand.  It is an exciting time at CorTechs Labs.

Over 150 institutions around the world are currently benefitting from the use of NeuroQuant.  It is allowing medical professionals to have an exciting new, state-of-the-art tool that directly quantifies atrophy of the brain. The response has been nothing short of remarkable.  It is the only FDA cleared medical device to provide fully-automated quantification of regional brain volumes at a fiscally conscience valuation.  This allows a comparison to a normative database - adjusted for specific criteria (age, gender, cranial volume) - to support a physician's impression of the presence of neurodegenerative illness.  This invaluable software coupled with the ability to track volumes across time has begun to transform the assessment of Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, traumatic brain injury and other neurodegenerative disorders.  It also allows an enhanced ability to determine the efficacy of therapies and treatments.

We hope you will join the community of NeuroQuant users in "CorTechs on the Brain" and share your experiences, research and practices.  Together we can impact millions of lives.  An exciting journey has begun and with your help the future will be truly phenomenal.  Please tune in to "CorTechs on the Brain".
