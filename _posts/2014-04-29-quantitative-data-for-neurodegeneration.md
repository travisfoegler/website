Quantitative evidence of neurodegeneration is fundamental to many clinical assessments.  It provides objective support for neurologists' clinical impression.  That's what NeuroQuant does. As the <em>first</em> FDA-cleared software solution for quantitative assessment of 3D MRI brain images, NeuroQuant helps doctors assess whether cognitive complaints are a result of a neurodegenerative disease or a curable mimic.

With NeuroQuant's automatic segmentation you will replace statements like “mild involutional changes” and “age-appropriate atrophy” with objective and consistent measurements of brain atrophy, which will help you predict your patient’s clinical course. Interested in this process? View the video below for the complete story behind NeuroQuant.
