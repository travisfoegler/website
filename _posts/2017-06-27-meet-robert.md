Advances in computing and communications have made many things much easier, for well and ill. It is an ongoing effort to ensure it is for the better.

As an engineer at CorTechs Labs, Robert is focused on meeting customer needs through delivering reliable products that are easy to use.

Robert started programming in elementary school on a Commodore PET ("press play on tape 1"). He has worked through the Kilobyte, Megabyte, and Gigabyte generations.Â  Gigabytes are better.

Robert still uses a flip phone, but does look forward to having a self driving car by the time he is old enough to need one.
